## Version Control

The site was created using the Gitpod Code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository ‘Graciekan21/arts’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

- Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal

The project will now have been cloned on your local machine for use.

Install Dependencies:

```npm install```
